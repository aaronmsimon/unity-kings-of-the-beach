I used to love this game as a kid. Actually, I still do. The Paris Olympics have got me playing this again. I want to find a fun game like this to play, but with modern tournament rules. Basically, replay the Olympics. Maybe even have an arcade vs simulation style depending on how realistic you want to play.

I would like to actually finish this game this time. That means starting with a working MVP and then expanding upon it. In order to do so effectively, I'll need to break it down into it's basic parts. Similar to Code Monkey's [Kitchen Chaos](https://youtu.be/AmGSEH7QcDg) and [XCOM](https://www.gamedev.tv/dashboard/courses/26) courses.

### Process

#### Environment
1. ~~Create field of play with textures~~
2. ~~Create net with colliders~~
3. Stadium
4. Skybox
5. ~~Stadium Scoreboard~~

#### Player - Arcade
1. ~~Create Player Controller - Movement~~
2. ~~Create player model~~ (using [Imphenzia's Crispoly Character](https://imphenzia.com/crispoly-characters-mini))
3. ~~Create Player Controller - Bump~~
4. ~~Raycasts for collision detection to prevent movement~~
5. ~~Lock player in place to target~~
6. ~~Implement a State Machine to control movement/locking~~
7. ~~Aiming Bump~~ with Accuracy
8. ~~Don't move immediately after Bumping (from aiming)~~
9. ~~Animations~~
10. ~~Feint Spike~~
11. Block calls
12. Confidence (post point, skip option)

#### AI - Arcade
1. ~~AI Controller - Move towards target (while ball is active)~~
2. ~~AI Controller - Bump~~
3. ~~AI Controller - Aim logic~~
4. ~~AI Controller - State Machine~~
5. ~~Estimating out of bounds~~
6. ~~Defensive positioning~~
7. ~~Pass towards teammate~~
8. ~~Offensive positioning~~
9. Block calls (making & obeying)

#### Gameplay
1. ~~Randomness in aim~~

#### Skills
1. ~~Speed~~
2. ~~Pass Accuracy (affects aim, AI only)~~
3. Dig (more important with speed of ball)
4. ~~Serve Skill (affects serve aim)~~
5. Serve Power (affects ~~speed and~~ direction)
6. ~~Blocking (likelihood to be successful)~~
7. ~~Spike Power (affects speed)~~

#### Ball Mechanics üèê
1. ~~Move to Target with Bezier curve~~
2. ~~Ball Fields and Properties~~
3. ~~Ball Events triggered when Property Set‚ùì~~
4. ~~Ball State Machine (probably need to change ballstate.bump to inair/active/inplay/etc)~~
5. ~~Display target on playing surface (to help player)~~
6. ~~Ball into net based on Raycast - cleanup needed: checking twice~~
7. ~~Ball detection outside of legal range at net~~

#### Assistants
1. Coach - Bump
2. Coach - Set
3. Coach - Spike
4. Coach - Serve
5. Coach - Block

#### Rules
1. ~~Same player can't hit ball twice in-a-row~~
2. One side can only hit ball three times on side
3. ~~Point when ball hits ground (in/out depending on who last touched)~~
4. Switch sides after 7 points
5. ~~Must pass over net (between sides)~~

#### Presentation
1. ~~Cinemachine~~
2. ~~Post Processing - Bloom~~
3. Scoreboard
4. Instant Replay for in/out calls

#### Menus
1. Game setup: choose players
2. Game setup: choose outfits
3. Game setup: choose points/set, sets/match
4. Pass setup info to Match scene

### Concepts/Ideas
- use right stick to reach for ball on dig
- amount of power, direction, depends on angle of ball, how quickly can get under it, etc
- is amount of power based on how long button is held?
- block calls
- confidence, high five/hug after every point and hold hands when changing sides
- NEW interaction concept!!  hold for dig, press & release for directed pass/shot
- Replays
- Argue calls
- Pass will be the gameplay mechanic for both Dig and Set, but Set will be more accurate
- adjustments for men vs women (spike speed, net dimensions, etc)

### Cleanup
- is it better to create a static TagHashes class instead of hard-coding tag strings?
- magic numbers
- debug: writing to console, gizmos like raycasts or boxes drawn
- bump/set vs pass/across
- athlete raycast isn't used
- exchange Distance() for ().sqrmagnitude when possible
- review all state machines for proper state handling
- don't actually need all these variables (events, too?) as Scriptable Objects

### Note to Self
4. spike tweaks for player
* might need to make this easier/more forgiving (higher collider and/or longer window)
5. adjust spike speed based on timing accuracy (perfect height)
6. UI: use [Game UI Database](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/)
7. BallInfo.cs has BallServedEvent() which should just be called from SetServeTarget() and not on the Athlete states
8. should there be different controls for serving? using "bump" to interact
9. DigReadyState.cs CalculateSpikeTarget() should determine if AI wants to do a feint
10. don't chase ball when won't be served over net [need to come up with better possession logic - serves, hit 3 times]
11. different AI states for receiving a serve vs defense during a point
12. check block with hits for team accuracy
13. really want to test the full game features and need to - yet AGAIN - reimagine the athlete/team/match setup for ease of debug, which will also enable tutorials and practice

In case there are issues with passing/spiking ball, consider the LockedOn feature
